	Abstract = { Shared-memory multiprocessors commonly use shared
		  variables for synchronization. Our simulations of real
		  parallel applications show that large-scale cache-coherent
		  multiprocessors suffer significant amounts of invalidation
		  traffic due to synchronization. Large multiprocessors that
		  do not cache synchronization variables are often more
		  severely impacted. If this synchronization traffic is not
		  reduced or managed adequately, synchronization references
		  can cause severe congestion in the network. We propose a
		  class of adaptive back-off methods that do not use any
		  extra hardware and can significantly reduce the memory
		  traffic to synchronization variables. These methods use
		  synchronization state to reduce polling of synchronization
		  variables. Our simulations show that when the number of
		  processors participating in a barrier synchronization is
		  small compared to the time of arrival of the processors,
		  reductions of 20 percent to over 95 percent in
		  synchronization traffic can be achieved at no extra cost.
		  In other situations adaptive backoff techniques result in a
		  tradeoff between reduced network accesses and increased
		  processor idle time. },

	Abstract = {We provide tight upper and lower bounds, up to a constant
		  factor, for the number of inputs and outputs~(I/Os) between
		  internal memory and secondary storage required for five
		  sorting-related problems: sorting, the fast Fourier
		  transform (FFT), permutation networks, permuting, and
		  matrix transposition. The bounds hold both in the worst
		  case and in the average case, and in several situations the
		  constant factors match. Secondary storage is modeled as a
		  magnetic disk capable of transfering $P$~blocks each
		  containing $B$~records in a single time unit; the records
		  in each block must be input from or output to
		  $B$~contiguous locations on the disk. We give two optimal
		  algorithms for the problems, which are variants of merge
		  sorting and distribution sorting. In particular we show for
		  $P=1$ that the standard merge sorting algorithm is an
		  optimal external sorting method, up to a constant factor in
		  the number of~I/Os. Our sorting algorithms use the same
		  number of~I/Os as does the permutation phase of key
		  sorting, except when the internal memory size is extremely
		  small, thus affirming the popular adage that key sorting is
		  not faster. We also give a simpler and more direct
		  derivation of Hong and Kung's lower bound for the FFT for
		  the special case $B = P = O(1)$.},

They give tight theoretical bounds on the number of I/O's required to do external sorting and other problems (FFTs, matrix transpose, etc.). If $x$ is the number of blocks in the file and $y$ is the number of blocks that fit in memory, then the number of I/Os needed grows as $\Theta (x \log x / \log y)$. If parallel transfers of $p$ blocks are allowed, speedup linear in $p$ is obtained.},

	Abstract = {In practice, almost all dynamic systems require decisions
		  to be made on-line, without full knowledge of their future
		  impact on the system. A general model for the processing of
		  sequences of tasks is introduced, and a general on-line
		  decision algorithm is developed. It is shown that, for an
		  important class of special cases, this algorithm is optimal
		  among all on-line algorithms.\par Specifically, a task
		  system $(S,d)$ for processing sequences of tasks consists
		  of a set $S$ of states and a cost matrix $d$ where $d(i,
		  j)$ is the cost of changing from state $i$ to state $j$ (we
		  assume that $d$ satisfies the triangle inequality and all
		  diagonal entries are 0). The cost of processing a given
		  task depends on the state of the system. A schedule for a
		  sequence $T^{1}, T^{2},\ldots{}, T^{k}$ of tasks is a
		  sequence $s_{1}, s_{2},\ldots{}, s_{k}$ of states where
		  $s_{i}$ is the state in which $T^{i}$ is processed; the
		  cost of a schedule is the sum of all task processing costs
		  and the state transition costs incurred.\par An on-line
		  scheduling algorithm is one that chooses $s_{i}$ only
		  knowing $T^{1}, T^{2}, \ldots{}, T^{i}$. Such an algorithm
		  is $w$-competitive if, on any input task sequence, its cost
		  is within an additive constant of $w$ times the optimal
		  offline schedule cost. The competitive ratio $w(S, d)$ is
		  the infimum $w$ for which there is a $w$-competitive
		  on-line scheduling algorithm for $(S,d)$. It is shown that
		  $w(S, d) = 2|S|-1$ {\em for every task system\/} in which
		  $d$ is symmetric, and $w(S, d) = O(|S|^{2})$ for every task
		  system. Finally, randomized on-line scheduling algorithms
		  are introduced. It is shown that for the uniform task
		  system (in which $d(i,j) = 1$ for all $i,j$), the expected
		  competitive ratio $\bar{w}(S,d) = O(\log|S|)$.},

	Abstract = {We propose a version of cache oblivious search trees which
          is simpler than the previous proposal of Bender, Demaine
          and Farach-Colton and has the same complexity bounds. In
          particular, our data structure avoids the use of weight
          balanced B-trees, and can be implemented as just a single
          array of data elements, without the use of pointers. The
          structure also improves space utilization. \par For storing
          n elements, our proposal uses $(1+\epsilon) n$ times the
          element size of memory, and performs searches in worst case
          $O(log_B n)$ memory transfers, updates in amortized
          $O((log_2 n)/(\epsilon B))$ memory transfers, and range
          queries in worst case $O(\log_B n + k/B)$ memory transfers,
          where $k$ is the size of the output. \par The basic idea of
          our data structure is to maintain a dynamic binary tree of
          height $\log n+O(1)$ using existing methods, embed this
          tree in a static binary tree, which in turn is embedded in
          an array in a cache oblivious fashion, using the van Emde
          Boas layout of Prokop. \par We also investigate the
          practicality of cache obliviousness in the area of search
          trees, by providing an empirical comparison of different
          methods for laying out a search tree in memory.},

	Abstract = {A growing imbalance in CPU (central processing unit) and I/O
  (input/output) speeds has led to a communications bottleneck in distributed
  architectures, especially for data intensive applications such as multimedia
  information systems, databases, and grand challenge problems. Our solution is
  to schedule parallel I/O operations explicitly. We present a class of
  decentralized scheduling algorithms that eliminate contention for I/O ports
  while maintaining an efficient use of bandwidth. These algorithms based on
  edge coloring and matching of bipartite graphs, rely upon simple heuristics
  to obtain shorter schedules. We use simulation to evaluate the ability of our
  algorithms to obtain near optimal solutions in a distributed context, and
  compare our work with that of other researchers. Our results show that our
  algorithms produce schedules within 5% of the optimal schedule, a substantial
  improvement over existing algorithms. (20 refs.)},

@article{Franklin79,
	Abstract = {[from the introduction] An important problem in database
		  processing is the manipulation of a set of $N$ records with
		  keys chosen from a key space of cardinality much greater
		  than $N$. This means that a bit map of the set is
		  infeasible. Some typical operations include the following:
		  (1) finding the record with a given key, if it exists; (2)
		  finding the record with the next higher (or lower) key than
		  a given record, whose location we may or may not already
		  know; (3) finding all the records with keys in a certain
		  range; (4) adding a record to the set and (5) deleting a
		  record from the set. \par This paper presents a new data
		  structure, the padded list, that does all the above
		  operations in expected time $T=\theta(\log\text{}\log N)$
		  if the record keys are drawn independently from a known
		  probability distribution. However, if the keys are selected
		  by an adversary, the worst case time for padded lists, like
		  hash tables, is $T=\theta(N)$.},

	Summary = {Three reasons to use non-blocking synchronization in the Cache Kernel: 1) synchronous code can be executed in asynchronous signal handlers, as in OORPC; 2) minimizes interference between process scheduling and synchronization; 3) non-blocking synchronization provides greater insulation from failures. Three synergies: 1) (asynchronous) signals are only kernel-supported notification; 2) tolerance of threads being terminated (fail-stopped) in the middle of ``system library'' code, such as handling a page fault, etc; 3) isolation of synchronization from scheduling and thread deletion allows modular and reliable system design. Implementation uses: atomic DCAS, type-stable memory management, and contention-minimizing data structures.},

		  as a padded list, a controlled density array or a sparse
		  table, containing records $\{R\sb i\}$ each uniquely

		  $\bold L$ is required to support the operations
		  $\roman{Search}(\bold L, k)$, $\roman{Insert}(\bold L, k)$
		  and $\roman{Delete}(\bold L, k)$ to search, insert and
		  delete a record with key $k$. To optimize
		  $\roman{Search}(\bold L, k)$, records are stored with their
		  keys in sorted order. If the order of the keys is to be
		  maintained under insertion, records currently in $\bold L$
		  must be moved to free space. To improve the efficiency of
		  $\roman{Insert}(\bold L, k)$, records are stored in a
		  circular buffer with `gaps' so that insertion necessitates
		  moving only records up to the next gap. The array is
		  expanded and contracted during a sequence of insertions and
		  deletions depending upon the current number of gaps. In
		  this paper we assess the amount of work required to insert
		  a sequence of records.},

	Abstract = {We prove that the {\em work function algorithm\/} for the
		  $k$-server problem has a competitive ratio at most 2$k$-1.
		  Manasse et al. [1988] conjectured that the competitive
		  ratio for the $k$-server problem is exactly $k$ (it is
		  trivially at least $k$); previously the best-known upper
		  bound was exponential in $k$. Our proof involves three
		  crucial ingredients: A {\em quasiconvexity property\/} of
		  work functions, a {\em duality lemma\/} that uses
		  quasiconvexity to characterize the configuration that
		  achieve maximum increase of the work function, and a {\em
		  potential function\/} that exploits the duality lemma.},

There are two kinds of locks: read locks and write locks.'' Nested actions: ``To keep the locking rules simple, we do not allow a parent action to run concurrently with its children.'' ``In addition to nesting subactions inside other actions, it is sometimes useful to start a new top action inside another action. Such a `nested' top action, unlike a subaction, has no special privileges relative to its parent; for example, it is not able to read an atomic object modified by its parent. Furthermore, the commit of a nested top action is not relative to its parent; its versions are written to stable storage, and its locks are released, just as for normal top actions. Nested top actions are useful for benevolent side effects.''},

		  strategy for distribution sort that is applicable to a wide
		  variety of parallel disks and parallel memory hierarchies
		  with both single and parallel processors. The simplest
		  application of the strategy is an optimal deterministic
		  algorithm for external sorting with multiple disks and
		  parallel processors. In each input/output (I/O) operation,
		  each of the $D \geq 1$ disks can simultaneously transfer a
		  block of $B$ contiguous records. Our two measures of
		  performance are the number of I/Os and the amount of work
		  done by the CPU(s); our algorithm is simultaneously optimal
		  for both measures. We also show how to sort
		  deterministically in parallel memory hierarchies. When the
		  processors are interconnected by any sort of a PRAM, our
		  algorithms are optimal for all parallel memory hierarchies;
		  when the interconnection network is a hypercube, our
		  algorithms are either optimal or best-known.},

	Annote = {(Bradley Thursday, October 3 2002): The idea of this
		  invention is that each memory module has a scratch buffer
		  cache. The processor can write several items to the buffer,
		  and the tell the memory module to commit them. To commit,
		  the memory module takes the items from the buffer and
		  writes them to the memory. To abort, the memory module
		  takes the old values from the buffer and writs them to
		  memory. Even if the processor fails in the middle, the
		  memory will be consistent.
		  
		  Some differences from our work: It is not clear how to make
		  transactions that involve memory locations in two different
		  memory modules. Also, it is not clear how to make
		  transactions that are too big to fit in the scratch
		  buffer.},

	Abstract = {On-line algorithms service sequences of requests, one at a
		  time, without knowing future requests. We compare their
		  performance with the performance of algorithms that
		  generate the sequences and service them as well. In many
		  settings, on-line algorithms perform almost as well as
		  optimal off-line algorithms, by using statistics about
		  previous requests in the sequences. Since remembering such
		  information may be expensive, we consider the use of
		  randomization to eliminate memory. In the process, we
		  devise and study performance measures for randomized
		  on-line algorithms. We develop and analyze memoryless
		  randomized on-line algorithms for the cacheing problem and
		  its generalizations.},

	Abstract = {Problems whose data are too large to fit into main memory
		  are called {\it out-of-core} problems. Out-of-core
		  parallel-I/O algorithms can handle much larger problems
		  than in-memory variants and have much better performance
		  than single-device variants. However, they are not commonly
		  used---partly because the understanding of them is not
		  widespread. Yet such algorithms ought to be growing in
		  importance because they address the needs of users with
		  ever-growing problem sizes and ever-increasing performance
		  needs. \par This paper addresses this lack of understanding
		  by presenting an introduction to the data-transfer models
		  on which most of the out-of-core parallel-I/O algorithms
		  are based, with particular emphasis on the Parallel Disk
		  Model. Sample algorithms are discussed to demonstrate the
		  paradigms (algorithmic techniques) used with these models.
		  \par Our aim is to provide insight into both the paradigms
		  and the particular algorithms described, thereby also
		  providing a background for understanding a range of related
		  solutions. It is hoped that this background would enable
		  the appropriate selection of existing algorithms and the
		  development of new ones for current and future out-of-core
		  problems.},

		  number of input/outputs (I/Os) required between internal
		  memory and multiple secondary storage devices for the
		  problems of sorting, FFT, matrix transposition, standard
		  matrix multiplication, and related problems. Our two-level
		  memory model is new and gives a realistic treatment of {\em
		  parallel block transfer}, in which during a single~I/O each
		  of the $P$ secondary storage devices can simultaneously
		  transfer a contiguous block of $B$ records. The model
		  pertains to a large-scale uniprocessor system or parallel
		  multiprocessor system with $P$ disks. In addition, the
		  sorting, FFT, permutation network, and standard matrix
		  multiplication algorithms are typically optimal in terms of
		  the amount of internal processing time. The difficulty in
		  developing optimal algorithms is to cope with the
		  partitioning of memory into $P$~separate physical devices.
		  Our algorithms' performance can be significantly better
		  than those obtained by the well-known but nonoptimal
		  technique of disk striping. Our optimal sorting algorithm
		  is randomized, but practical; the probability of using more
		  than $\ell$ times the optimal number of I/Os is
		  exponentially small in $\ell (\log \ell) \log (M/B)$, where
		  $M$ is the internal memory size.},

We define what it means for abstract data types to be atomic and resilient. We also discuss issues that arise in implementing such types, and describe a particular linguistic mechanism provided in the Argus programming language.''},
